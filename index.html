    <h1>SOB (Sprite OBject) File format</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Refreshers:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>SCH contains sprite characters, in a map 256 pixels wide.</li>
        <li>SCL contains 16 palettes, where each palette contains 16 colors entry is in RGB555 format (2 bytes), the
            entry at index 0 can be assumed to represent a transparent pixel</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Note: What's described here was mostly figured out from the game's code and toying around in dolphin, it might
        be incomplete. Things like frame timings are hardcoded into the game.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/nbouteme/fsasobdoc">Source code</a> for this page if you need some reference
        implementation from the renderer at the bottom of this page.
    </p>

    <p>
        The SOB file format is used to describe how to layout character data (from .sch -> Sprite CHaracter) to render a
        sprite.
        .SCH files don't contain sprites strictly speaking, but chunks of sprites.
    </p>

    <p>
        Multi-bytes values are in little endian (contrary to the Gamecube being a big endian system).
    </p>

    <p>
        The header is just a short word of two bytes, indicating how many sprites are described in a given .sob file.
        Let's say there are N sprites. Then the header is followed by N pairs of short integers, that are offset
        relative to the beginning of the file.
        These offsets are the beginning and end of attribute data for a single sprite. Each attribute is made of 6
        bytes, so the difference between the beginning and end offset is always a multiple of 6. The game renders them
        starting from the last.
    </p>

    <p>
        This file format does not describe which palette it uses, and which pages (continue reading to know what I'm
        referring to as a page) are mapped to which number, it is assumed to be the responsibility of the game engine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here's a description of what each of the 6 bytes does:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Byte 0: height, as a signed 8 bit value. This isn't strictly speaking just a y-offset, as its value is
            considered
            when drawing things like sprite shadows.
        </li>
        <li>
            Byte 1: The first 2 MSBs describe a Block Shape (see the block section), the other 6 bits are unused, I've
            only
            seen
            them set to 0. The game's renderer shuffles them around but never reads them.
            int block_shape = (attr[1] >> 6) & 3;
        </li>
        <li>
            Byte 2: x-offset, as a signed 8 bit value.
        </li>

        <li>
            Byte 3: Object attributes: Only the high-nibble of that byte is used. The 2 MSBs control the Block Size (see
            the
            block section), the following two bits control flipping along the y and x axis respectively (going from msb
            to
            lsb)
            int block_size = (attr[1] >> 6) & 3;
            bool flip_y ((attr[3] >> 5) & 1) != 0;
            bool flip_x ((attr[3] >> 4) & 1) != 0;

        </li>
        <li>
            Byte 4: PageOffset, an unsigned byte that represents a character's origin position in multiple of 8 pixels.
            When
            reaching the end of a row, an increment goes at the beginning of row below.
            This means this byte can only display what's within a 256x64 pixels "page"
        </li>
        <li>

            Byte 5:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    MSB nibble: palette selector. Nothing much to say, 4 bits, 16 different values, one for each palette
                    in a given SCL file.
                </li>
                <li>
                    LSB nibble: page selector. This implies there can only be 16 different "pages" (slices of 256x64
                    pixels
                    character
                    data) mapped at once.
                </li>
            </ul>

            From what I've seen, the game only has these 16 pages mapped, coming from 5 different SCH files.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    0, 1, 2, 3: gb_ch_obj_base_sch. It's 256x256, so it occupies 4 pages. Used for items, link's arms,
                    certain NPCs and long lived objects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    4, 5, 6, 7: ennemy_sch. Certain ennemy sprites.
                </li>
                <li>
                    8, 9: gals2_sch. Certain NPC sprites
                </li>
                <li>
                    a, b: player_sch. Link's body.
                </li>
                <li>
                    c, d, e, f: gals_sch. Other NPC sprites.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Blocks</h2>
    <hr />

    <p>
        Attribute data defines where to start pulling character data, and uses 4 bits to determine the dimensions in
        pixels
        to pull.
    </p>

    The Block Shape and Block Size, 2 bits each;
    They describe regions of 8x8 blocks.

    <p>
        There are three types of block shapes: Square (BlockShape = 0), Wide (BlockShape = 1), Tall (BlockShape = 2).
        Using
        a BlockShape = 3 makes the game read out of bounds and interpret incorrectly bytes describing the sizes.
        There are 4 different sizes for each type of Shape.
    </p>

    For the Square Shape:
    <pre>
    0: 1x1 blocks
    1: 2x2 blocks
    2: 4x4 blocks
    3: 8x8 blocks
    </pre>

    Wide shapes:
    <pre>
    0: 2x1 blocks
    1: 4x1 blocks
    2: 4x2 blocks
    3: 8x4 blocks
    </pre>

    Tall shapes:
    <pre>
    0: 1x2 blocks
    1: 1x4 blocks
    2: 2x4 blocks
    3: 4x8 blocks
</pre>


    <h2>
        Rendering
    </h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Rendering a given sprite ID at coordinates [x;y] consists of the following steps:
    </p>

    <ul>

        <li>
            Get the sprite attribute list
        </li>
        <li>
            Starting from the last attribute, the going to the first:
        </li>
        <li>
            Determine the shape in pixels (get the block size, multiply by 8)
        </li>
        <li>
            Determine the origin point in the CHaracter data page ((PageOffset & 0x1f) << 3 for the x coordinate,
                (PageOffset>> 5) << 3 for the y coordinate) </li>
        <li>
            Ensure you have the CHaracter data somewhere ready to be used, with the
            proper palette
        </li>
        <li>
            Extract the proper region
        </li>
        <li>
            Draw the extracted region at [x;y] with the following
            considerations:
        </li>
        <li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    add the x/y_offset to the coordinate
                </li>
                <li>
                    if that coordinate is flipped, you have to negate the corresponding offset AND add a bias to the
                    final coordinate that is equal to the extracted region dimension
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>SPL File format</h1>
    <hr>
    <i>
        Based on the only SPL file in the game I could find
    </i>
    <p>
        SPL is a rather simplistic file format.
        Is it a sequence of 4-short integers tile attributes.
        Each of these integers describe where to pull a 8x8 block of tile data from the associated SCH and how to flip
        it.
        Combining these 4 shorts describes a 16x16 tile. The shorts describe the tile in top-down/left-right order.
        Here's the layout of one 16-bit integer:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The first 4 MSB describe the palette to use;
        </li>
        <li>
            The next 2 describe if the tile is flipped, MSB is the y axis, the other is the X axis;
        </li>
        <li>
            The next 5 bits describe the (8x8) block y-index in the CHaracter data
        </li>
        <li>
            The last 5 bits describe the (8x8) block x-index in the CHaracter data
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>MAP files</h3>
    Map files are just a 2x2 block of 32x32 blocks of tile indices in short little-endian format.
